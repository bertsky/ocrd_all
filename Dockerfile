# ocrd/all: fat container integrating (most) OCR-D modules
# pros:
# - single-point of update for docker installation
#   (just as ocrd_all is single-point of update for
#    repo/executable names and dependencies/idiosyncrasies)
# - flexibility in using unpublished changes from modules
#   in a consistent state (just as ocrd_all for local installation)
# - no need to prepare/synchronize module containers for
#   docker-compose / kubernetes
# cons:
# - needs submodules checked out at build time,
#   which implies a huge (1.5GB) build context
# - needs to pull in all possible dependencies,
#   which implies a huge (6.7GB) final image
# - danger of running into inconsistent dependencies
#   between modules (just as ocrd_all for local installation)

# use OCR-D base container (from ubuntu:18.04)
FROM ocrd/core
